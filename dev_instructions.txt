the aim of this project is to create a simple vanilla web portal that is used to let the user 
interact with GlidrU. This is a vanilla web portal application
which displays questions that the user
wants to ask for their college selection process.

The underlying data is stored as a json file in the data file @data/prompts_for_college_data.json. For the 
web portal the user will see a friendly UI that allows them to edit this file.

The first step of the project is to create a simple, friendly welcome page that allows a user to navigate
to the Questions page where they will see the questions as they currently exist in the json
file based on class.
